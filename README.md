# Assessing the liquidity premium in the Italian bond market
## Abstract
This paper studies the effects of time-varying liquidity in the market for Italian government bonds and proposes a new methodology to estimate the liquidity premium implicit in bond prices. After adjusting for different maturities and coupon rates, we compute a yield spread between on- and off-the-run ten-year BTPs and regress this quantity on seven well-established liquidity metrics, explicitly distinguishing between current and future liquidity. We find that higher liquidity is indeed reflected in higher prices. Based on these results, we obtain a novel estimate of the liquidity premium, according to which the liquidity deterioration that occurred during the sovereign debt crisis lasted longer, but was of a smaller magnitude than that recorded during the Covid-19 pandemic.
